* Jupyter notebook

This notebook is a simple jupyter notebook. It only has markdown and code cells. And it does not contain consecutive markdown cells. We start with an addition:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  a = 1
  b = 2
  a + b
#+END_SRC

Now we return a few tuples

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  a, b
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  a, b, a+b
#+END_SRC

And this is already the end of the notebook
